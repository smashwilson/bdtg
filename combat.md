# Combat

Combat in Blood Down the Gullet should feel mostly familiar to veterans of 4E. You'll roll initiative to determine the turn order for this combat. Within each turn, you'll have one move, one minor, and one standard action to take, with the ability to trade any down to a lesser action (taking an additional move instead of a standard, for example). You'll have a small library of ability cards as part of your character sheet, most of which will involve rolling a d20, adding some base score, and comparing the result to an enemy's defense value.

The major differences that you'll notice will be in how abilities are consumed and recharged, and how movement is tracked.

## Skill Charges

You still have **At-Will** abilities, which you can use as many times as you like. However, you'll no longer have encounter and daily powers. Instead, each non-At-Will ability will have a *charge number* on it.

At the beginning of the day, put a number of charge tokens on each ability card corresponding to its charge number. Each time that you use one of those abilities, remove a charge token. Once the charge tokens are gone, you can't use the ability any more that day.

Some abilities may give you the choice of using additional charge tokens to enhance their effect somehow. You have to choose to spend the tokens before you roll.

Some abilities may allow you to restore charge tokens to other characters or yourself. The granted tokens can be placed on any ability with a charge number. You *may* add additional tokens above the charge number. They'll persist until you use them, or the next extended rest, whichever comes first.

After a combat encounter, you'll naturally regain two charge tokens in the same manner. After an extended rest, all abilities reset to the number of charge tokens equal to their charge number.

## Movement

Rather than a battle grid, the area available for movement within combat is represented by a graph. Each node in the graph is a significant landmark, piece of cover, or other location of interest within the battlefield where players and enemies may gather. Moving between two connected nodes costs a single move action.

There's no limit to the number of characters who can be at a particular node at one time. Conceptually, everyone there is milling around in a drunken stupor trying to flank and stab one another all the time.

### Ability Ranges

Any characters at the same node are within **melee** range. Any characters at other nodes are **ranged**. Things like cover and lines of sight and effect are mediated by the GM.

Most abilities will target a single target within the relevant range. **Burst** abilities target *all* eligible targets in a targeted node. Melee burst abilities hit all targets at the same node as you; ranged burst abilities hit all targets in a node you choose (that you can reach).

### Opportunity Attacks

Moving through a node occupied by a hostile character gives that character a chance to smack you one while you pass through. They can use any At-Will ability to do so.

Each character gets only a single opportunity attack per round, unless I forget, in which case they get more than one.

Opportunity attacks are also granted against any hostile character using a ranged ability while in melee range.

### Combat Advantage

Because we're not tracking the finer details of who's flanking who, you can assume you've got combat advantage against any hostile character:

 1. At the same node as you,
 2. While you have at least one ally there,
 3. Who didn't attack you last round.

You also have combat advantage against opponents who don't know you're there, or can't see or hear you.

Combat advantage does *not* grant a +2 bonus to attacks, though. Mostly it's useful for triggering Rogue / Drummer abilities.
