# Music

A *concert* is an event consisting of a series of songs, in which the band attempts to accrue points that effect their growing [Fame](fame.md), while not killing *too* many of the audience lest they anger the hosting town, village, or nation-state.

Concerts proceed with a sequence of turns that players take, going around the table in a simple loop. The band can choose whomever they wish to take the first turn.

## Songs

The first player to take a turn names the song they're playing. Songs become progressively more difficult to play as they last, but also award more points (as long as they're played well).

While playing a concert, the band has a **multiplier** that determines the number of points the current player may accumulate on their turn. The multiplier begins at 1. Playing successfully for consecutive turns will rapidly increase the multiplier, while flubbing a turn will reset it.

## Turns

A typical turn consists of either one or two actions:

1. The player makes a **performance roll** to determine how competently they're actually, you know, playing their instrument.

   The difficulty of the roll begins at 10 and increases by 1 for each successive turn in the current song.

   *On a success:* The band earns a number of points equal to the current multiplier. The band's multiplier is then doubled, to a maximum of 16.

   *On a failure:* The band earns no points, and the band's multiplier is reduced back to 1 unless the player saves face with a successful stunt.

2. The player may choose to perform a **stunt**. A stunt can be either a special concert action that's listed on the player's character sheet or whatever crazy, ad-hoc nonsense they want to try to do.

   The difficulty of the stunt roll depends on the action that's being attempted. Concert actions describe their difficulty. Ad-hoc stunts have a difficulty determined by the DM and announced before the roll is made: either Easy (5), Medium (10), or Hard (15).

   If the *performance roll* this turn was a failure, but the stunt is a success, the player still earns no points, but the band's multiplier is preserved.

   If the *performance roll* was a success and the player succeeds with a stunt, the band earns more points. Concert actions describe their point rewards, while ad-hoc actions earn points based on their assigned difficulty: Easy (half multiplier), Medium (multiplier), or Hard (double multiplier).

   Knowing the band, stunts are also likely to involve a casualty count. Casualties accumulated during the concert are tallied by the DM.

## Finishing a Song

At the beginning of any turn, any player may state a desire to **finish** the current song and begin the next. Successfully finishing a song will reset the difficulty of the performance rolls back to 10, but risks resetting the multiplier as well.

Finishing a song in a satisfying crescendo requires participation from the whole band. All players roll 1d20 and sum the results. If the total is greater than 10 times the number of players, the song has been finished and the multiplier carries over to the next. If the total is less than that, the song is still over, but the multiplier is reset to 1.

The player then introduces the next song, and the concert continues with the next player's turn.

## Failure

If a full round passes with no passed performance checks, the band is booed off the stage.

## Finishing a Concert

Concerts are over when we get bored with them.
