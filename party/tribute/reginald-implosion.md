## Backstory

Reginald Marigold Implosion, of the North Hestwich Implosions, was orphaned at a young age when his parents attended Blood Down the Gullet's aptly named "Tour of No Return" (said tour also included no return for the concertgoers as well as the band itself).  Years of growing up in the Goodtimes Orphanage hearing tales of the band that emphasized its many exploits and deemphasized the "parent murder" aspects led Reginald toward a career as a bard.  Classically trained at the Bard's College, he's freshly graduated and returned to the orphanage to help Father Goodtimes put together a band to help out the next generation.

Reginald patterns himself after BDtG frontman Nathaniel Explosion to the point of star worship and beyond.  He:

  *  Knows the lyrics to every BDtG song, and has developed intricate and long-winded interpretations that nobody else shares.
  *  Spent years and hired a voice coach to be able to imitate Explosion's voice.  Though he can do this well, he still retains the high-class accent of his normal voice.
  *  Routinely wears corpse paint.  And his regular fancy clothes.

Despite this, he hasn't quite internalized the brutality the band is famous for.
