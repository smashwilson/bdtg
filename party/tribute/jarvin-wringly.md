## Backstory

> He's a 4'0" gnome wizard that dabbles in the forbidden arts of Necromancy. Using the bones of the cursed and the dead, he brings the whispers of the deceased to the ears of the "soon to be deceased".
>
> People made fun of his given name. People make more fun of his stage name, which he thought was " wicked cool" and "super goth" however is kinda lame, since he really plays up the goth aspect of it all.
>
> Oh, he's barely 18, and is 50 lbs wet.
>
> And a rock superstar is born.

> So I'm thinking that he conjures smoke (and therefore an ambiance buff) and then he (or someone) can set that explosive smoke on fire, creating fire and concussive damage.
>
> He can create any color smoke but it always ends up being black smoke, the color of his tortured heart.
>
> Also his bone machine creates weird unnatural sounds that are unsettling. Either they speak dark whispers into the very soul of the listener...or more often than not, are confusing, and conjure the often asked question, "Is...is that a dead cat skeleton you're using for those spells, because that sounds like my cat Fluffy when she's in heat?"
>
> Spoiler alert: it might be. It just might be.
